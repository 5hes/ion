// DESCRIPTION
// fn prints a list of all functions that exist in the shell or creates a
// function when combined with the 'end' keyword. Functions can have type
// hints, to tell ion to check the type of a functions arguments. An error will
// occur if an argument supplied to a function is of the wrong type.
// The supported types in ion are, [], bool, bool[], float, float[], int,
// int[], str, str[].
//
// Functions are called by typing the function name and then the function
// arguments, separated by a space.
