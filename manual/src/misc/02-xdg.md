# XDG App Dirs Support

All files created by Ion can be found in their respective XDG application directories. In example,
the init file for Ion can be found in **$HOME/.config/ion/initrc** on Linux systems; and the
history file can be found at **$HOME/.local/share/ion/history**. On the first launch of Ion, a
message will be given to indicate the location of these files.
