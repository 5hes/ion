# Variable Assignments

The `let` builtin is used to create local variables within the shell, and apply basic arithmetic
to variables. The `export` keyword may be used to do the same for the creation of external
variables. Variables cannot be created the POSIX way, as the POSIX way is awkard to read/write
and parse.
